So yeah, the image you just saw is of my junior high school. Apparently, my junior high was the most prestigious junior high in Ho Chi Minh City. We have a whole ass entrance exam for god's sake. Entrance exam, for 10-year-old kids. Imagine that.

In Vietnam, junior high goes from grade 6 to 9. That's 4 years in case you forgot how to count.

I'm gonna use this post to recount my experience in junior high. Just remember one thing very well. *I'm* writing this post.

#### 1. Grade 6

5 years of elementary school was rather hectic for me, to say the least. I was very much a timid and reclusive kid. I didn't want to get involved in anything. Unfortunately, my classmates were on the exact opposite extreme of the spectrum. They were hyperactive, period. There wasn't a single shit they didn't pull on other people. There wasn't a single week where we didn't get scolded by our homeroom teacher. Now, I didn't do shit. But in a class where 40 out of 50 students were pranksters, you might as well scold the whole damn class eh? I was also a very sensitive kid. So much that any kind of scolding would hurt me, regardless of the circumstances.

Now, I don't want to be discriminate or anything, but my elementary school wasn't in the greatest neighborhood, to say the least. And like it or not, environment is a very real factor in your child's growth. So, after some amount of hard work, by the end of grade 5, I got admitted into the most prestigious junior high of the city. My life should be perfectly peaceful at this point, right?

Yeah, it was right. For exactly 1 week.

Turns out, just because you're a prestigious student doesn't mean you're not capable of being an asshole. In fact, in my case, being a prestigious student made it even fucking worse. There were 35 students in my class, me included. Two thirds of them were massive trolls. Oh yeah, girls included.

If you were me and you didn't really like to conform to society, and by society I mean my class, then you received a bunch of things from your classmates ranging from mere teases to just outright insults. I wanted nothing to do with them, yet they never once considered sparing my life. Somehow I still maintained my politeness to them. What the fuck was I thinking?

Being the pranksters of the royal court that they were, they would do just about anything to prank someone else and earn either discomfort, sometimes hatred, from other students, or punishments from the teachers. And let me make this very clear. **The teachers**, not a teacher. And you might have guessed, the punishments didn't do shit. They remained the absolute pranksters that they were.

At some point, every single one of our teachers just had a very long face whenever they had to step into my class. Homeroom teacher included.

There was this thing called the grade leaderboard. Our grade 6 had 15 classes in total, so that was a leaderboard of 15 classes. Throughout the week, a class received points for doing good things, and lost points for doing bad things. And then, on the morning of every Monday, the weekly leaderboard was revealed (and then resetted afterwards). I am **not** exagerrating when I say that my class never made it beyond the rank of 13.

After every leaderboard revelation, we would always get a big scolding from our homeroom teacher. Well, our performance was basically saying our homeroom teacher couldn't manage us at all, so the scolding was inevitable.

At the end of grade 6, some idiots in my class decided to let the whole class watch *Sword Art Online* and *Shokugeki no Souma*. And they made a very clear intention of emphasizing the ecchi sections. I didn't even know what anime was at the time, but those idiots completely ruined my first impression of anime. Thank god I became a proper weeb in grade 9 and learned how goated *Sword Art Online* actually was. Them soundtracks go hard indeed.

#### 2. Grade 7

Oh how much I want to say that things could have remained the same. Not that it was a good thing to keep it around anyway, but zero escalation would have been nice.

Instead, a new girl transferred from another class into our class. She quickly became our class president (yep, I hecking love democracy). And holy shit... *She* was the greatest prankster of all times, the greatest prankster of a class full of S-tier pranksters. And thanks to her authority as class president, our reputation as a class quickly went straight into the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Back then it was only somewhere near the Titanic, mind you.

Our new homeroom teacher already knew our reputation going into the new school year. Yet, even she was not prepared *at all* for the chaos unleashed in my grade 7. At that point, I had matured a bit more, enough to feel bad for my homeroom teacher. Still, that didn't keep me from feeling hurt whenever she or any other teacher scolded the whole class.

At some point during the school year, I learned that one of the *few* dudes I befriended in grade 6 was actually childhood friend with our class president ever since grade 3. But uh, that didn't help. He was more or less willing to let his beloved childhood girl do whatever she wanted, and just happily accepted whatever consequences wrought upon us later. Why did he do that?

I also grew enough to realize that two thirds of my class were rich kids. Meanwhile, I was an ordinary kid from an ordinary family. No fucking wonder.

Oh yeah, did I mention that I always maintained my politeness towards my classmates despite everything they had done? Yeah, I also got taunted for being "the exemplary student" of the class. Funny, I know. I was just trying to live a peaceful junior high school life. They never let me go.

Grade 7 ended with me saying goodbye to our current campus to go back to the main campus for the rest of junior high. Good god that secondary campus was nothing but a nightmare. Damn ground so low it was flooded year fucking round.

#### 3. Grade 8

At this point, we were back to main campus, and our reputation was that of the most infamous class of the entire junior high school. Amazing, I know.

In my place, we always had this prestigious city-level contest near the end of grade 9. So training was to begin when grade 9 began, and selection was thus done at the end of grade 8. So grade 8 just turned into a year of grinding for the selection test. I could barely do math, but I couldn't do any other subject at all, so I decided to grind math anyway. I didn't really want to do any of it, but my parents goaded me into trying, so I did just that.

As always, my class' reputation was truly something to be feared among students and teachers. You could call it a legend even, and you wouldn't be exagerrating much. It was very hardly the case that you could find a class so bad that it induced trauma into every single teacher who ever had the misfortune of having to teach that class. But somehow, we had one, and it was my class. Terrific.

My best friend (at that time anyway) had a crush on a girl! I tried to be the best wingman ever, and I was fucking excellent at it. Too bad, his interest in her went away after 2 months or so. Instead, I had a crush on her. I even dreamed of a family with her. Dear lord I was pathetic.

Our beloved class president got into a relationship with a dude who was also a class president just right next door. Unfortunately, it turned into a Korean drama. It wasn't exactly pleasant having to see my class president crying over that dude on a weekly basis.

At this point, I had begun to drop my nice guy act. If they didn't do anything to me, then I simply feigned ignorance to their existence. If they did, I would just get unruly rude and pissed off. Somehow I never cursed at them, at least not right into their face. I would also just refuse to offer any help to any of them, unless they begged me so bad that I had to give in just to not escalate shit any further.

The only time I felt no hostility was when I was with the girl I had a crush on. It just felt so warm and cozy to be around her. That was probably why I dreamed of a family with her.

At the end of grade 8, I somehow passed the selection test for math. I still don't know how that happened, even until this day. My parents cheered me, my few friends cheered me, the girl I had a crush on cheered me. But uh, somehow I wasn't very excited.

#### 4. Grade 9

Now, there were two big things for me. One, train my ass off for the prestigious math contest. Two, grind my ass off for the entrance exam into the most prestigious high school of the city.

Stress level was off the roof. I could barely keep up with anything, not even my normal schoolwork. At one point, I dropped one of my cram class because I just wanted to sleep.

Even then, it wasn't enough. I no longer felt any joy in studying. Yeah, I should have been studying for my future, but somehow that was no longer relevant to me at the time. So I began to find things I could indulge in. Didn't take me long to become a full-time weeb. Worse yet, I began to spend the majority of my time to binge watch game playthroughs on YouTube. I was one good laptop/console away from being a full-time gamer.

Surprisingly, my class was a bit more well-behaved during the last year of junior high. Didn't keep us from getting scolded weekly by homeroom teacher, but overall, we pissed the teachers off much less than we did over the previous 3 years.

Turns out, all my classmates were a whole hell lot more talented than me. Whether it was academia, sports, arts, music, or whatever. I only got my reputation as an excellent student because I grinded way too hard. But then I already dropped the grinding at that point, for reasons mentioned above. Somehow I still made it into top 5 of the class leaderboard. I guess my classmates just really didn't care about the class leaderboard.

I remained grumpy and spiteful towards my classmates. At least nothing in that department got worse. As for the girl I loved, I still loved her. But I also realized she deserved better. Not some guy who was more than willing to lash out at the first sight of discomfort. So I withheld my confession forever. I already received enough from seeing her smiling so brightly and happily everyday.

I somehow got the silver medal for the math contest, despite having been the worst guy in the training camp. Guess I got lucky.

We hosted a buffet party as our last gathering before junior high graduation. Many tears were shed. I could feel the vivid and strong emotions. I just couldn't be bothered to feel the same way `my classmates did.

I somehow got myself admitted into the most prestigious high school of the city. The girl I loved also passed the entrance exam, but she chose a different high school since the prestigious one was too far from home. And that was the last I saw of her. Yeah well, my mental health kinda deteriorated during high school, so that was for the best I guess.

#### 5. Final words

Her name was Julie. Well, not her real name of course. This was in Vietnam, remember?
