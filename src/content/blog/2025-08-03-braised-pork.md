Despite the thumbnail, this is not your beloved Chinese braised pork. This is my mom's recipe, or rather, a recipe she made for me because I couldn't be bothered to gather all the ingredients for the most authentic experience possible. Plus, I'm Vietnamese (despite being mistaken as Chinese **every single time**).

I like to call it simplified braised pork. So, here's the recipe for simplified braised pork. All credits goes to my mom.

# Ingredients
- 500g of pork belly
- Salt
- White vinegar
- Cooking wine
- 1 lemon
- 1 white onion
- 3 cloves of garlic
- Sugar
- Coconut water
- At most 6 chicken eggs

# Pre-preparation
## Pork belly
- Rinse pork belly under warm water to soften it (cuz you put it in the fridge after you bought it).
- Cut pork belly into pieces of 2cm width (that's centimeters you're looking at).
- Soak pork belly in a mixture of warm water, 2 tbps of salt, 2 tbps of vinegar, 2 tbps of wine, for 30 minutes. This gets rid of the raw pork smell, soften it further, and allows it to better absorb the seasonings.
- Dice white onion and garlic. Dice them to be as fine as possible. Or use a blender, that also works.
- After 30 minutes, put pork belly into a container (you can even use a ziploc bag). Add salt, onion, garlic and 1 tbps of lemon juice. Marinate pork belly in fridge for 3 hours.

## Eggs
- Prepare a pot of water. Put all eggs into pot. Turn on stove to number 7.
- Wait for roughly 20 - 25 minutes. At around 15 minutes, water will start boiling, but **do not** turn off the stove just yet, since at this point, your eggs are only soft-boiled. You certainly **do not** want soft-boiled eggs for this dish. Trust me, I made my share of mistakes.
- Once eggs become hard-boiled, put them into a bowl of cold water. Then peel the eggs.
- After peeling, you may choose to cut each egg in half.

# Cooking
- Grab a pot.
- Put 4 tbps of sugar into pot and perform caramelization. This gives a better flavor profile and color profile to the dish.
- Once you have obtained caramel, take pork belly out of the fridge and put it into pot.
- Add coconut water. You can add as much as you want.
- Put stove at number 5 and cook it for around 30 minutes.
- Add the hard-boiled eggs, put stove at number 3 and cook it for another 30 minutes.

There you have it!
