Today, you ain't gonna listen to me yapping. Every now and then, you'll get to hear my friends yapping about random stuff instead. And I'd like to call them guest bloggers.

The most popular games on mobile phones nowadays are gacha games. Hell, the most popular games on PC and consoles might also be gacha games. You might have heard of the recent boom of *Umamusume Pretty Derby*, a gacha game about horse(girl) racing, when a bunch of popular streamers played it. But gacha games have existed since forever, and is probably not going away anytime soon.

For anyone who doesn't know, the main feature of gacha games is, well, the gacha. Basically, you spend currency, then you get random stuff, and if you're lucky, the stuff you actually want. You get a small amount of currency through playing, but if you want to roll more, you have to spend some real life cash. This makes gacha games unappealing for many people, because **gambling**.

Well, I'm here to tell you that you can enjoy gacha games without having to worry about all that. As someone who didn't really like the gacha concept, I've found myself having fun with a good amount of gacha games.

The main thing is the story that comes with the game. Lots of gacha games have a story behind their "main quests", but they are generally pretty easy and don't require a whole lot of grinding (there are exceptions, cough cough *Puella Magi Madoka Magica Magia Exedra*, but we'll talk about this one later). And many of them are very good. To go back to our example in *Umamusume*, each character in the game has a unique story event to view. The writing is going to win any awards, but it's still a fun read each time. I heard that the main story gets really good later on too. Apparently there are some depressing storylines in the future, so that's something to maybe look forward to. And it's not just the horse girls, many other games out there have a great story too. My friends keep talking about the *Arknights*, there's an anime adaptation of *Blue Archive* out there, there's a lot of interest in the *Genshin Impact* world, and the *Granblue Fantasy* universe is very well-loved by fans. So, lots of stuff to choose from. If you are a fan of visual novels, or just reading light-hearted stuff in general, you might really enjoy gacha stories.

Another angle is the gameplay (weird that gameplay is not the main appeal of a **game**, but here we are). Now, gacha games isn't exactly known for their stellar gameplay. In fact, it might be the opposite. Tons of games use very similar gameplay, and it's very rare that any of them are engaging at all. But there's still a way to get some excitement out of it. The trick is to be a masochist, and by that I mean to not make the game too easy. Let's talk about *Magia Exedra*. You have 5 units, they can either do a basic attack, which give you SP, or use their skill, which cost SP. Attack enough and they charge their special attack that you can use for big effects. Basically, click enough buttons and the enemies die (if you're a fan of Hoyoverse games, this may sound familiar, as it's the exact same system as *Honkai: Star Rail*!). So how do you make this fun? By being at half the recommended power level of course. Now you have to think about strategy and trying to counter the boss, which adds a lot to the gameplay experience. It feels so good to clear a stage underleveled (and you can brag about it to all your friends too). Of course, there exist gacha games with actual good gameplay. Play some tower defense in *Arknights*, or slash at enemies in *Zenless Zone Zero*. All I'm saying is you can always create your own fun.

One last thing, here is how to **not** enjoy a gacha game: Doing your daily missions like it's work or any other sort of grinding (such as pulling your hair out for the prefect 9â˜† spark legacy). If you're not a hardcore fan or is the type of person who needs to have your favourite character or die, this is guaranteed to make you quit after a few weeks. Don't fall for the trap.

Anyways, go out there and play some gacha games. Extra fun when you have a friend who also plays or watch your game streams.
