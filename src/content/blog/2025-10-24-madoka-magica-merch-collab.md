Welcome to yet another post where I go high on *Madoka Magica*. You should be expecting this stuff at this point.

If there's one thing I would complain about *Madoka Magica*, it's that the girls in the series always wear exactly two costumes: the school uniform and the magical girl costume. Now, the magical girl costumes are all nice and lovely, but the girls aren't always in their magical girl form. And for whatever reasons, the only "casual" clothing the girls have ever worn in the series is their school uniform. Well, Kyouko does have her casual outfit, but she doesn't attend school.

And I'm not just talking about the 12 episodes or the 3 movies (tho funny enough, movie 1 actually had Madoka wear a new casual outfit for exactly 1 scene). There were no casual outfits in the official mangas or the games either. As such, long-time fans of *Madoka Magica* tend to develop a hidden desire to see their precious girls in casual outfits, whether they realize they have that desire or not. On one hand, casual outfits always look very nice! On the other hand, the uniform and the magical girl outfits serve as reminder of a story of despair, hope and love. So yeah, you can see why we want them casual outfits.

This is where the merch collabs come in. You see, with every merch collab, there's always an illustration of the girls wearing different casual outfits. The illustration simply serves as promotional art for the merch, which is typical enough. But for us long-time fans, oh no my dear, it serves a far greater purpose than just that. It serves to fuel our great fantasy of the girls enjoying a peaceful daily life. Every single time a merch collab is announced and the promotional art is revealed, within the next 12 hours, there will be dozens of fanarts drawing the girls in their casual outfits. And every time that happens, I will spend 2 hours collecting every single fanart I can find. And what makes you think I'm the only one actively searching for those arts? Yeah, we fans of *Madoka Magica* can get that crazy when it comes to these sorts of things.

I mean, just look at the thumbnail. Aren't they just so precious and adorable?
