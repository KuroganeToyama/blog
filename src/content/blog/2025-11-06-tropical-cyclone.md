I come from a country that is plagued by tropical cyclones on a yearly basis, starting from July and neding in December. I'm not exaggerating, and I don't want to exaggerate either. Anyways, because of my origin, naturally I got curious about how tropical cyclones are formed. In the lingo, it's called cyclogenesis. Cyclo- means circular, and -genesis means formation. So, cyclogenesis means formation of circular stuff.

Now, if you want the most comprehensive documentation ever on how cyclogenesis works, you can read it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclogenesis). But if you want a summary, then continue reading this post.

Consider an ocean. At a specific time of the year, it gets warm. When it gets warm enough, the water evaporates. This creates warm and moist air. And since this air is warm, it rises up. At some height, that air cools down and condensation takes place, i.e. clouds and rains. Gas state has more energy than liquid state, so when gas state does manage to become liquid state (i.e. condensation), the process releases a lot of energy. This energy makes the air that has yet to condense gets even warmer and rise higher. This part right here leads to two simultaneous things that are core to cyclogenesis.

First, more and more air is pulled upwards. This leaves the ocean surface with much less air, or in the lingo, much less pressure. Now, we have an area on the ocean surface that has lower pressure than its surroundings. Air moves from high pressure area to low pressure area. So naturally, the surrounding air rushes into this area. You'd think it rushes inwards in a straight line. Well, you're not wrong, but the Earth rotates. So a straight line trajectory becomes a spiraling trajectory. In the lingo, we call this the Coriolis effect. The surrounding air rushes inwards in spiraling motions. Now you're starting to see why cyclones spin.

Second, there's this thing called the tropopause. It's the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere. The troposphere is the lower region of the atmostsphere where heat comes from the ground, so the higher you go, the colder it gets. The stratosphere is the upper region of the atmosphere where heat comes directly from the ozone layer absorbing the sunlight, so the higher you go, the warmer it gets. But the core thing is, the statosphere, having direct sunlight as heat source, is warmer than the troposphere. So, think about the warm air that has been rising. Now, it meets the tropopause and it cannot go any higher, because the air above is warmer than the rising air. So the rising air spreads outwards at the tropopause. This effectively fans out the surrounding air. By nature physics, the higher you go, the lower pressure becomes. Now, thanks to this additional fanning effect, we have an area up and above where the pressure is even lower than the ocean surface area we just talked about in the previous paragraph. Air moves from high pressure area to low pressure area. So naturally, right after the surrounding air rushes into the lower area, it rises up.

And you can see where this is going on. Air moves in, air rises up, condensation releases energy, and air moves in, air rises up, etc. The whole process keeps inviting more and more air spiraling inwards and upwards. In the lingo, we call this a feedback loop. If nothing goes wrong, this feedback loops goes on for a couple of days until it gets strong enough to be labeled a tropical cyclone.

Now you know why a tropical cyclone spins with such strength. You also know why a tropical cyclone always carries heavy rains with it. But why does it even move? Well, the ocean currents and the winds guide the cyclone. And because those two things obey certain patterns, any tropical cyclone formed in the Pacific Ocean will eventually make its way to the Southeast/East Asia region. And that's where Vietnam is.

Within the past decade, the average ocean temperature has risen. You may be tempted to think that an increase of 0.5°C is barely anything. Yeah no, it's not just not barely anything, it's a fricking disaster. Do you even realize just how much water there is in a single ocean? Do you understand just how much energy it takes to raise such a volume of water by 0.5°C? That's several nuclear bombs we're talking about. So yeah, that much more energy fuels much much more destructive tropical cyclones. The damage that my country has suffered from recent cyclones is at least three times as much as any previous year.

And that's not all. Climate change has significantly changed the patterns of the ocean currents and the winds that guide the cyclones. The result is that the tropical cyclones now have a strong tendency to slow down on its path to the mainland. And this sucks *royally* because slowing down means it has more time to pick up more energy from the ocean and thus gets even stronger. So yeah, none of that is good on any level whatsoever.

As of this year of 2025, my country (and several other countries in the same region) has experienced unprecedented destructive powers from the tropical cylones, and along with that, unprecedented levels of property damage and human casualties. And I really have to wonder if there even is a viable option to mitigate the loss when mother nature is like this.

So uh, if you still refuse to believe that global warming and climate change are both very real despite the fact that we're in 2025, do me a small favor. Go fuck right off.
