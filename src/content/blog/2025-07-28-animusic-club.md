Well, you can read the banter image, right?

I first learned about this club in Winter 2023, my very first semester at the University of Waterloo.

I was interested in discovering different clubs, and I had been a weeb for a good 5 years at that point, so I thought to myself, "Might as well give it a try".

The first event I attended was the End of Term (EOT) Concert of the same term. The event began at 5:30PM, but doors were always open 1 hour early. I decided to arrive right at 5:30PM because I thought not that many students are weebs anyway.

Oh boy how wrong was I.

The moment I entered the concert room, every single seat was filled. I was left standing for the entire duration of the concert, which was roughly 3 hours. But the concert was so amazing I didn't even realize my legs were on the verge of collapsing until after the concert had ended.

It was my first time witnessing anime and video game music performed on a professional level, like what you would expect at a classical orchestra. Of course, since this was a club, it didn't reach that kind of professionalism, but it was still very impressive nonetheless.

For someone who *adores* anime/video game music and barely gives a shit about pop music, I knew that I had found *my* club. I knew that no matter what happens, no matter the cost, I *have* to attend the concert **every single term**.

And thus begins my newfound goal in life. Ever since that fateful winter, whenever March, July, and November approaches, I have always looked forward to the EOT concert. And I have never once failed to attend any of them.

Whenever the concert posters begin to appear around campus, I always take a picture of it and try to figure out what songs/tracks would be performed in the concert.

Before concert day, I always make sure I have dealt with all assignments. I want to make my mind as clear as possible to enjoy the concert to its fullest.

I learned from my mistake during the first concert. On concert day, I always arrive very early to secure the central seat, the best possible seat to observe the orchestra.

At some point, I even got my friend, who was living on the other side of the earth, to join me in the concert every term. The club offers live stream of the concert, and with that, I somehow managed to convince him to throw away his sleep for 1 night every 4 months.

And that's not just it.

With every passing term, the quality of the concert gradually improves.

The first concert, the room didn't have enough seatings.

The second concert, they chose the biggest lecture hall on campus.

The third concert, they provided live stream of the concert. There was a delay of 30 seconds. Ever since, live stream has always been available in EOT concerts.

The fourth concert, they improved the layout of the stage to make sure all performers are always comfortable. And to protect the drummers and the drum set as well.

The sixth concert, they added lighting to the concert. It made the concert looked even more like a proper concert. Ever since, lighting has always been available in EOT concerts.

The eighth concert, which occurred on July 27, one day before this blog is posted, they improved the programming of the lighting, offering an even more surreal experience. They also improved the streaming quality, with the delay reduced to 5 - 10 seconds.

The only thing that hasn't quite improved is the quality of the skits they use to introduce the next performance. Sometimes it's normal, sometimes it's funny, sometimes it's cringy. But I find that mix of quality a unique thing of the EOT concert.

Funny enough, after the seventh concert, I got so enthralled that I decided to ball and write an email requesting some music for the next concert. More specifically, I requested for a Madoka Magica medley. And if you know me, you know precisely just how much I wanted to listen to that medley.

And it actually happened. **It. Actually. Happened**. Whether they went with my request or it was just a coincidence, **it actually happened**.

During the concert yesterday, they performed the Madoka Magica medley. They chose the best tracks of the series and made the best out of them. Their perforamce was so mesmerizing, I was completely lost in my own world for the entire duration of the performance.

Aaaaand I decided to make another music request, because I got greedy. This time, I asked for Steins;Gate. We shall see how this goes.

I'd like to think that even when I have graduated, I will always attend EOT concerts. Doesn't matter if I go to Toronto, go to the states, or go back to my place. I **will** attend EOT concerts.
