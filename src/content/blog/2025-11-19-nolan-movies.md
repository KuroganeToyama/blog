Image source: It's one of the official posters for the movie *Interstellar*. I think I don't need to tell you why there is both source and no source for this image at the same time.

Frankly, and oddly enough, I didn't learn about Christopher Nolan's movies because I was a cinephile, or even someone who was slightly interested in movies. I knew about Nolan's movies because quotes from his movies got memed everywhere on the internet when I was growing up as a teenager. Yeah, his movies were that influential. They defined a whole ass culture among both the movie enthusiasts and the general public. Chances are, you might or might not have seen his movies, but you definitely have seen quotes from his movies in the form of memes. What better way to preserve culture, eh?

I did have the idea of writing a post to yap about why Nolan's movies are unique. It can be a masterpiece, or just outright nonsense depending on the person next to you, but each and every of his movies is unique in its own way nonetheless. But I figured that I wanted to do something else. Not because there are already 1000 different YouTube videos dissecting Nolan's movies and his unique cinematography among Hollywood, I couldn't care less about that. But because I had a better idea in mind.

Thus, today, we're gonna talk about famous quotes from Nolan's movies that you might have already known and go a bit deep into those quotes.

#### 1. The Dark Knight Trilogy

The best trilogy about Batman and Nolan couldn't even care less about franchising it. In fact, that was the greatest reason why this Batman trilogy has been, is, and will be the only great trilogy of its kind.

Anyways.

<blockquote>
"Why so serious?"
</blockquote>

The (in)famous line from the Joker in *The Dark Knight*. The line suits the character perfectly well, a madman who always finds thrill and humor in the midst of chaos. But it isn't just a nice catchphrase for the character. "Why so serious?" *is* the Joker's worldview. He finds the foundations of society completely meaningless, and that humans "are only as good as the world allows them to be". Humans take specific issues seriously simply because the foundations of society tells them so. For the Joker, nothing is serious, period. The Joker believes in the inherent chaotic nature of humans, and therefore society rules are simple a bad joke to him. And, you know, he isn't quite far off. Humans are in fact chaotic. We love and hate. We brave and fear. We save and kill. We are literally the embodiment of paradoxes. Ethics and moralities came about because we had always had a need to survive as a group, or otherwise none of us would survive on our own. Today, that group is what we call society. Ethics and moralities were never part of being a human. So really, society, while still strong, is more fragile than you might think.

<blockquote>
"It's not about money. <br>
It's about sending a message. <br>
Everything burns."
</blockquote>

Another (in)famous quote from the Joker. Money in particular, or materialsm in general, is also just another we humans came up with as we gradually became a society. Strip society away and we're simply left with the human nature. And human nature is chaos. Or in the Joker's words, "everything burns".

<blockquote>
"You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."
</blockquote>

A rather ironic quote coming from Harvey Dent, who later became the villain known as Two-Face. The quote definitely mirrored the story of Harvey Dent in *The Dark Knight*, but it's also more than just that. It speaks about a core truth of society: being the good guy and wielding power more than often do not come hand in hand. When you don't wield power, then shit's simple, whatever you do doesn't really affect anything anyway. But the narrative shifts when you do. Suddenly, you have to balance between the personal good and the greater good. Pick one and you're bound to hurt the other, sooner or later. Perhaps you do remain the good guy for the first couple of years. And then you step down, and people will always remember you as a hero. But stay in power for long enough, and life will eventually force you to pick sides. You're just as much a hero in your own story as you are a villain in someone else's story. The quote is more than just a cool sounding line from a movie. It's quite literally a statement about life. Also, you might or might not have noticed this, but the line also applied to our titular character.

<blockquote>
"Some men just want to watch the world burn."
</blockquote>

Great wisdom from our beloved Alfred. Sure, the line did refer to the Joker and how Batman couldn't fight him using conventional methods. But are we sure we don't have such people in our world? Those who act without a cause, without a purpose? Those who act outside of our conventional framework of ethics and moralities? Perhaps we have more of those than we would like to admit. Perhaps some of them are even closer to us than we would like to think. Batman had to resort to breaking his own moral code (by spying on millions of people) to defeat the Joker. What can *we* do then? Food for thought.

<blockquote>
"Ah, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding!"
</blockquote>

Perhaps the most memed quote in the trilogy. There are probably more variants of this quote than there are sand grains on Earth. On one hand, it's a cool quote if you wanna trash talk someone who's trying to teach fish how to swim. On the other hand, it's a precautionary tale about those who are trapped in their own world and can never grow, just like a fish can never live on land. But I must say, I have laughed at variants of this quote more than I care to admit. It really is a very cool line.

#### 2. Interstellar

<blockquote>
"Cooper, what are you doing?" <br>
"Docking."
</blockquote>

And then *No Time For Caution* kicks in. An amazing introduction to the famous docking scene from the movie. But it isn't just about Cooper being cool, immediately taking things into action and saying a one-liner. It makes you wonder. How many times in our lives do we have the resolve to do what must be done, even when our fear says otherwise? How many times in our lives do we regret not having the resolve to do what must be done? It's always easier said than done.

<blockquote>
"It's not possible." <br>
"No. It's necessary."
</blockquote>

And this is where I tell you why Cooper had to dock. The *Endurance* is falling out of orbit and crashing into the planet. And without the *Endurance*, both Cooper and Amelia won't be able to go anywhere. CASE wasn't wrong when he said it wasn't possible to do what Cooper asked, to have the *Rangers* match the *Endurance*'s spin. 68 rpm, or 68 revolutions per minute. You try spinning yourself that fast for 10 seconds and I'll give you my praise if you don't pass out from that. And here, Cooper and Amelia would have to endure the spin long enough to perform the dock. The human condition is simply not designed to withstand that kind of spin. CASE called that out because by performing such spin, the chance of peforming a successful docking would be nigh zero. But Cooper essentially said "it's still not zero". Because the only alternative would be doing nothing at all, and that would definitely guarantee zero chance of survival. We have a phrase for that. "It's all or nothing". If the only alternative is guaranteed failure, might as well do whatever we can do. It's a really important mindset that we should have in our life. Our fear tends to get in the way of what is logically the only possible solution. And like it or not, we face the docking dilemma in our life more than any of us care to admit.

<blockquote>
"Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space."
</blockquote>

This line often gets passed off as being too sentimental coming from Amelia. But, is it really? Why do we still miss someone, even when we're thousands of miles from them? Why do we still miss someone, even when they're no longer in this world? Our brain is very good at removing memories that no longer mean anything to our life, yet love always remains. We can describe 100 different things going on in our brain when we experience love, but none of those explains what love really is. So really, love is sill quite a mystery for us.

In fact, an exchange between Cooper and Amelia also highlighted this, though many people conveniently ignored it.

<blockquote>
Brand: Maybe we've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory. <br>
Cooper: You're a scientist, Brand. <br>
Brand: So listen to me, when I say that love is not something we invented. It's observable, powerful. It has to mean something. <br>
Cooper: Love has meaning, yes. Social utility, social bonding, child rearing... <br>
Brand: We love people who've died. Where's the "social utility" in that? <br>
Cooper: None.
</blockquote>

Seriously people, pay more attention.

#### 3. Oppenheimer

<blockquote>
"Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
</blockquote>

Interestingly enough, the real J. Robert Oppenheimer actually said this after the success of the Trinity Test. The line is usually memed as a cool sounding one-liner. And I have also seen my fair share of variants. But for Oppenheimer, it was nothing but his realization and his horror of what he and his team at Los Alamos had unleashed upon not just the world, but also the future of the world. Oppenheimer wasn't excited that the atomic bomb worked, he was horrified that the atomic bomb worked. You and I feel this the best. We currently live in a world shaped by Oppenheimer.

<blockquote>
"When they've punished you enough, they'll serve you salmon and potato salad, make speeches, give you a medal, and pat you in the back telling all is forgiven. Just remember, it won't be for you... it would be for them."
</blockquote>

This line from Einstein alluded to what happened to the real Oppenheimer after the Trinity Test. But more than that, it speaks about the nature of our world. People blamed Oppenheimer because he created the atomic bomb. But Oppenheimer didn't change the world with his creation of the atomic bomb. It was the hostility of the world that changed itself with the creation of the atomic bomb. And then, when people finally forgave Oppenheimer and redeemed him, they didn't do it because they were genuinely apologetic to Oppenheimer. They did it to convince themselves that everything was inevitable, and that it wasn't their fault that the world just moved one step closer to self-destruction. Remember, a weapon is never inherently good or bad. Only the person using it is.

#### 4. Closing words

Go listen to Hans Zimmer's soundtracks. Goated stuff.
