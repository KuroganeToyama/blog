If you know me, you know where this is going.

If you don't know me but you have seen the thumbnail, you might also know where this is going.

To begin, *Ultimate Best* is a Madoka Magica album. The album includes songs from the anime, the movies, and several songs that only appear in the Pachinko and Pachislot games. Yes, there are pachinko machines based on Madoka Magica theme in Japan. Crazy, I know.

If you know me, then you know I ain't gonna yap about the songs that had already existed before this.

No, I'm here to yap about the new original songs that you can only find in this album (either that or you go to Akiba and play them pachinko machines).

Most notable in this album are character songs for the 5 girls of the main series, sung in the girls' voices as well. Which makes these songs really cool, vocally speaking. Though, this isn't the first time we have character songs like this for Madoka Magica. We already had 2 such songs in the main anime series. The first one is *Mata Ashita*, the official character song for Kaname Madoka, sung by her seiyuu Yuuki Aoi, serving as the ED for episodes 1 and 2 (we all know what happens from episode 3 onward). The second one is *And I'm home*, a duet character song for Miki Sayaka and Sakura Kyouko, sung by their corresponding seiyuu Nonaka Ai and Kitamura Eri. *Mata Ashita* is nice. I have a severely unhealthy obsession with *And I'm home*. You can have me listen to *And I'm home* non-stop for 3 hours and I would ask you to loop it for another 3 hours.

Anyways, back to the main topic. The character songs in *Ultimate Best* are really good, but unfortunately the wiki staff didn't bother enough to put the lyrics down. Instead, I had to find lyrics scattered across the internet. Fortunately, you now have this blog to quickly learn the lyrics of these character songs! (at least until the wiki staff decides to be more active).

Below, you can find the link to each song and its lyrics, as well as a little description for each song. Please give them a try, they're really good. Pretty please.

If you're wondering why the last song has a Soundcloud URL for the lyrics, then it's because that's the only place with English lyrics.

Also, please use the correct order for Japanese names (last name - first name). If you happen to be familiar with the contrary, then honestly, I don't give a shit. Maintain the original. Be a real weeb.
