The thumbnail is that of my high school. *High School for the Gifted* does sound kinda funny, I'll give you that. But in Vietnam, it's pretty normal.

Apparently, my high school is the most prestigious high school in Ho Chi Minh City. And probably the entirety of Southern Vietnam as well. *Apparently*. And at this point, I think you already know that I don't know how I got admitted into this high school. Sure, I passed the entrance exam, but that didn't explain shit.

Anyways, welcome to my 3 years of high school.

#### 1. Grade 10

My high school is what you'd call a specialized high school. Students are put into classes that focus on one subject more than anything else, and classification is done through the entrance exam. I got myself into the Math class. I actually somehow qualified for both English class and Computer Science class as well. But I chose math because my parents told me that was better. Honestly, they weren't exactly right.

My first impression of the school was "wait, are you sure this is a high school?". Because it honestly looked a lot more like an apartment complex converted into a high school. Which I wasn't too surprised if that was the case, but damn was the school ground smol. Also, have you ever heard of a high school buiding that was 7-story tall? Because my school had one. The other building was 5-story tall. Very good daily exercise I'll give you that.

Turns out, there was quite a nice perk of being in a class where everyone shares something in common. We math people were more or less introverted. Of course, there were still those in my class who enjoyed taunting other people, but compared to my junior high, that was mere child play, and I was more than happy to let that slide.

I quickly realized that my classmates got into this class because they had some amount of talent, and I got into this class out of sheer grind. And of course, there was only so much grinding could do. You simply do not compete against geniuses. I tried to catch up with my peers for 2 months before I got completely burned out. Self-esteem was all time low when I consistently received 6/10 on my regular exams. And no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't catch up at all. So for a while, I got depressed. Then I accepted the L. And I started grinding even more weeb stuff and game stuff.

One guy from my junior high class still ended up my classmate, but he wasn't very interested in being friends with me. If anything, he was still hooked up with his beloved childhood girl friend, who was then in the Biology class. You know, the same junior high class president that gave me nightmares every week. Made me wonder if he actually had some romantic feelings for her. Though, I had read enough romcom mangas at that point to know what would happen next. Nothing good.

I didn't really make any new friends either. I did know some guys from my cram schools, who also ended up my classmates, but even back in cram schools we never got beyond mere classmates. My self-esteem was quickly declining at the time, so I didn't bother with making new friends anyway.

For whatever reasons, students in the Math class were also expected to excel at natural sciences, that being Physics, Chemistry and Biology. I did fine at Physics. Chemistry and Biology were horrifying. It didn't help either that the teachers for these 3 subjects were in fact teachers from Physics class, Chemistry class and Biology class. What the fuck?

Good news, we didn't have that much homework. Bad news, we had a lot of group presentations. I rarely had pleasure working in a group in junior high, unless I was working with my dear crush. Out of 10 group presentations I did in grade 10 or so, 6 of them were very memorable for the very wrong reason. My teammates just outright refused to contribute to anything, so I had to carry the fricking team every single time. Once, Literature teacher had us do a play. I ended up being the playwright, coordinator, director and even supporting actor. Dude, not cool.

Covid-19 hit Vietnam like a truck during the second semester of the school year. We stayed at home and didn't begin online learning until 2 whole ass months into the semester. 2020 was fucking wild.

Grade 10 ended with me dreading high school, my self-esteem hitting rock botttom, and my lonely ass having no friends. In addition to me staying at home 24/7.

#### 2. Grade 11

Covid-19 was now gone, for the most part. Back to in-person learning.

And I thought grade 10 was bad enough. Oh how naive I was.

It wasn't enough that 11/13 subjects had us do group presentations on a weekly/bi-weekly basis. Two of those subjects had extremely demanding requirements, which sometimes just sounded downright bullshit. Also, 3 subjects required us to commit to a single group throughout the entire school year, so that was (not) fun. But we were students, so we had to suck it up, regardless of how we felt.

Physics and Biology didn't get that much worse. But Chemistry did. If I understood like 50% of the lectures in grade 10, then I barely understood any lecture in grade 11. And I was very much *not* alone in feeling that way.

By December of that year, I was nothing but all worn out, if grade 10 hadn't already worn me out. And as it turned out, the folks sitting around me were also feeling the same way. A certain Chemistry class was the tipping point. None of us understood what the fuck was going on in the lecture. Teacher did some practice problems and provided the solutions on the whiteboard, and we still didn't know what the fuck just happened. To make it worse, almost none of us had the time to note down the solutions before teacher wiped the whiteboard to do more practice problems. Save for one guy who was able to take photos just in time. So, after the class period, we reached out to him for them precious photos. And to make it simple for everyone, we decided to create a Discord server and have him send the images in there. Later, we also helped each other's ass out in other subjects.

I thought it was gonna be just that. A Discord server for us to help each other out with schoolwork. After a month or so, it became a place for us for us to rant about our group work. After another month, it became a place for us to yap about weeb stuff, as we realized that some of us were weebs and some were considering the path. After another month, it became a place for us to yap about whatever was going on in the world. After another month, we even yapped about our personal lives and families. At that point, I had had my very first group of close friends, and I didn't even realize it at the time. It just felt nice to chat with them about anything really.

There was one dude in my class who was quite the Prince Charming. Or so we thought. He tried to hook up with girls from the Literature class across all 3 grades. He ended up with none. Well, he did end up a sad boi for some time.

Turns out, the goofy dudes of my class were constantly hitting on girls from other classes, especially Literature class. But apparently they got very bad rizz. So fucking bad, that my close group of friends, who never interacted with anyone outside of our class, received scornful looks whenever we passed by girls from the Literature class. And only then did we learn about how the goofy dudes fucked things up and sully the reputation of the Math boys. I knew two girls in Literature class from junior high, and we were on amicable terms back then. But then one day, as I walked past them, they looked at me with bullet eyes. What the fuck? I didn't do shit.

Fantastic developments were made during grade 11. Due to various different incidents and interactions between classmates, and due to the misunderstandings and hostilities resulted from those but were never addressed, my class splitted itself into 4 factions, unofficially. First was the Ruling Party, comprised of the class president and his fellow friends, all of whom were goofy af. Second was the Ladies Faction, comprised of the only 5 girls in the class (welcome to Math class) and 2 other dudes who frequently hanged out with the girls. Ruling Party and Ladies Faction were frequently at odds with each other, with no sides showing respect for the other and no quarters were given during an given confrontation. Third was the Ghosts, comprised of dudes who never interacted with any single thing in the class, ever. You never want to be in the same presentation group with them. And finally, there was our faction, the Alliance, as we liked to call ourselves. Our faction simply kept did our own things, never bothered to interfere with any conflict between Ruling Party and Ladies Faction. However, the Alliance held diplomatic relationships to both the Ruling Party and the Ladies Faction. But that didn't really lessen the tension, just that we people of the Alliance were able to learn insider stuff from each faction. We did have a very good spy, after all. And by spy I mean he was well-respected by both factions to be added to their respective group chats. The Ghosts were sometimes associated with the Ruling Party. Never with the Ladies Faction.

Oh yeah, did I mention that our Alliance had access to secret intelligence? Being the peaceful people that we were, we didn't do anything with all those information. We just discussed about them, yapped about them, and ocassionally I went on a rant when I saw something stupid. Sometimes we fantasized using what we learned, and uhh we went a bit too far more than often. This definitely did not involve a certain pair of twin girls who were our classmates.

At some point, one guy in the Alliance decided to confess to us. That he confessed to one of the twins and they had become a couple. It was a wild evening of revelation, let me tell you that. We were surprised to learn that he had a girlfriend, even more surprised that the confession took place during a very casual conversation, as they were cofiding with each other about how stressful school was, and how prepping for medical school was taking a toll on both of them. But then we all cheered for him. He got someone who was under the same circumstances as him, who knew what he was going through (because quite unfortunately none of us in the Alliance was heading for medical school), and someone with whom he could confide. That was peak relationship goal right there. God I wish you could have seen my face when I learned the news. I was grinning like an idiot.

Turns out, our class president had a crush on the other twin. He ended up with nothing.

Grade 11 ended up with my class completely exasperated from all the group work and class politics was as tense as it could be.

#### 3. Grade 12

Covid-19 returned and we all went back to online learning for the enitre first semester. Son of a...

As grade 12 students, we now had to focus on prepping for university. The damn national entrance exam was tough for no good reasons at all, so stress was rather high. Unless, you were aiming a group of universities that had their own entrance exam, similar to SAT, to select students. That exam was by no means simple either, but it was tough for very good reasons. Most of us in the Alliance grinded for the SAT. Unfortunately, medical school didn't use the SAT, so our dear friend with a girlfriend still had to grind for the national entrance exam.

Because it was now online learning 24/7 for us, our Discord server was constantly flooded with messages of us trying to save each other's ass during class and assignments. Some of us were good with Math and Physics yet sucked royally with Chemistry and Biology. Our soon-to-be medical student excelled int Chemistry and Biology, yet completely bombed Physics. Very few of us did well enough in Literature, me included, and so we had to save the group's ass. Doing regular exams over online learning was a truly ridiculous idea. But we made do.

Class politics remained just as tense as ever. At one point it just became a whole ass war between Ruling Party and Ladies Faction, with the Alliance observing the war thanks to our spy. Things never got better after that.

While we were still not spared from group presentations, unlike the previous 2 years, we got to choose our own group for every group presentation we were given, and boy did I finally felt truly happy working in a group. Communcation was never this great. I just loved my group of friends so much.

Every now and then, we got to see our medical friend enjoying his time with his girlfriend. So lovely. So sweet.

The SAT went by and most of us got early admission into our desired university and major. Still, we had to make sure we did not bomb the graduation exam.

The class decided to host a BBQ night party right beofre graduation. The party went alright. Several people got unbelievably drunk from 5% beer and soju. The sober ones, including me, had to escort them back to the room. We forgot to bring a scrub to clean the grills. Holy shit, washing the grills with nothing but bare hands and soap was a fucking pain.

Our medical friend got addmitted into medical school! Along with his girlfriend! He had probably the highest true total score, but he was placed at rank 10 in the leaderboard because other students with not as high true total scores received a fuck ton of additional regional points. Can we please fine tune the fucking system please?

Grade 12 ended up with members of the class going separate ways, my group of friends still in contact with each other over Discord, and IRCC trolling me for not submitting my visa application sooner.

#### 4. Final words

It's quite unlikely that we're gonna have any proper class reunion. Plus, my plane ticket is 4000 bucks round trip. Holy shit.
