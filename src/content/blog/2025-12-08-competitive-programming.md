The term *competitive programming* may sound unfamiliar to you. Well, ever heard of LeetCode?

Also, I'm gonna refer to competitive programming as CP from this point forward.

I do like to emphasize that this is not *How to CP 101*, or even *How to LeetCode 101* for that matter. There's like 1000 different blog sites for that already. Granted, not all of them are high quality, but they do be existing in abundance.

This blog post is simply my experience with CP, if you can even call it like that.

Frankly, I didn't even know about competitive programming until I was already in high school. And there's a fun story while we're at that.

My high school is specialized, in the sense that students are put into classes that concentrate on exactly one subject over others. Math class learns advanced math and dedicates more time for math. Physics class learns advanced physics and dedicates more time for physics. You get the idea. Now, it wasn't like we were learning university-level stuff or anything. Normal high school curriculum (in Vietnam, keep that in mind) has derivatives and integrals for calculus. Math class curriculum also has just derivatives and integrals for calculus, but we went deeper into those two things, deep enough to qualify for real analysis. Oh, did I just say that we didn't learn university-level stuff? Sorry, that was a lie. We just didn't do multivariable calculus, was all.

Among the classes, we have one called IT class (IT is short for Information Technology, in case you don't know). Now, the naming is misleading af. In normal high school curriculum, we have a compulsory subject called IT, where we learn what computers are, what software is, what hardware is, how to use this and that app, etc. So we do learn proper IT. But in IT class curriculum, that's not what they learn. Instead, they learn data structures and algorithms. Yeah, I'm talking about that DSA course that terrified thousands of CS students across universities (myself not included). And they also do LeetCode on a daily basis, except it's not LeetCode. And they also train their ass off for nationals and ICPC and IOI. You get the idea.

Now, as with any other classes in my high school, to get into any class, you need to pass the entrance exam. Even though I got admitted into math class, I did gather enough interest about coding in junior high that I decided to take the IT class entrance exam. For some reasons, the only language we 9th-graders were allowed to use back then was Pascal. Horrible, horrible ass syntax. Anyways, I took the exam, except I only knew how to code, *not* how to do DSA. So you could imagine how well I performed in that entrance exam. A flat 0. Had this been the math entrance exam, I'd probably still have got some partial marks for partial ideas. But uh, this was LeetCode (except it wasn't LeetCode), your marks came from passing test cases, and I didn't even write a single working program. Whoops.

At some point into high school, I realized that number theory and real analysis and discerete mathematics and advanced geometry weren't for me at all. I could barely follow any of those topics. And those were the only stuff taught in math class. Eventually, I got bored of the very subject I excelled in junior high. So I directed my attention to the art of doing whatever to solve coding questions like the ones in the entrance exam. Took me a while to learn the terminology. *Competitive Programming*. At some point I learned about Codeforces, where my IT class fellas participated in weekly contests over the course of 3 hours and I participated in one and decided to never do another CP contest. I still looked at the problems and attempted to solve them without much success and resorted to editorials, it's just that I didn't wanna do contests.

The folks in IT class had a proper curriculum. I did not. I jumped straight into the CP problems, attempted to solve them, realized that I could never after 3 hours, gave up on attempting, read the solutions, saw some weird ass concept I never knew about, Google the heck out of that concept to learn about it, did more practice problems on that concept. Eventually I covered everything from binary search to dynamic programming to range queries to graph search to whatever topic CP had to offer. That was how I practiced CP, in a nutshell.

And uh, I didn't even know LeetCode existed at the time. My only sources of CP problems were Codeforces, GeeksForGeeks, and 100 different CP contests in my country, ranging from schools to nationals and even internationals. Oh yeah, and them high school entrance exams as well.

Did I get that good at CP? Uh, no. I bothered enough to learn the data structure, learn the algorithm, and think about the approach to a problem. I didn't bother enough to actually code the damn thing. Turns out, in national and international CP contests, there's a whole lot of voodoo magic you need to know to optimize the heck out of your time. And like, if a problem asks you to implement Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for max flow, you need to be able to *immediately* recall the exact implementation, down to the very last line of code, and type the damn thing out as fast as possible. Too much sanity for me. So I didn't bother. I practiced CP like I was doing daily crossword puzzles, except even daily NYT crossword puzzles would have been a whole lot more preferable.

That was fun and all, but then grade 12 hit everyone like a truck and suddenly we had university entrance exams to care about. So for a while, I didn't bother with CP. And then I got into university. First year was boring af so I went back to playing around with CP. Turns out Waterloo has a whole lot of students with brains beeg enough to make it into the ICPC Finals. But Waterloo doesn't really have an organized club or team to even train for ICPC. University of South Florida does tho. My friend is in there. He's really smart.

I had to find a job right after first year. Welcome to co-op program, folks. That was when I learned about the existence of LeetCode. And I also found a fuck ton of online guides on how to grind LeetCode for your technical interviews. And yeah, do I look like I gave a shit?

Second year of CS major and everyone got hit with the DSA courses. I got out of those courses perfectly fine. Not that I got a 90% in those courses or anything, but they didn't become a nightmare for me like they did for my peers. You people thought these courses and LeetCode were painful huh? You ain't seen shit. Unless you already did ICPC, in which case you have my utmost respect and admiration.

Advent of Code has always been a thing, except I never bothered with it until this year when my friend goaded me into doing it. It was kinda fun actually. Except for day 6. Who the hell thought parsing challenge was a good idea?

In a nutshell, my experience with CP can be described in 2 lines. If you give me a problem and ask me to describe the solution, i.e. what data structure to use and what algorithm to use, I can give it to you on the fly. But if you tell me to also implement the solution on the fly, then I *am* gonna suck, quite a lot.

In fact, I just screwed up implementing BFS in my most recent technical interview.
