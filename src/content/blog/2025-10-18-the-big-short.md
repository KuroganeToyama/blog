Image source: Well, it's one of the official posters for the movie, so there's both source and no source at the same time.

*The Big Short* is a movie about the 2007-2008 housing crisis in the US that eventually blew up and became a global financial recession, also known as The Great Recession. The movie is based on a book of more or less the same name, *The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine*. The book consist of stories of different people/group of people who saw the housing bubble and the actions they took following that realization. It provides a very great insight into just how exactly we even got a housing crisis in the US to begin with, and how a housing crisis got so bad it blew up the entire world. It's a recommended read if you wanna understand more about that dark period. But the book can be quite intimidating for those who don't even know how finance works in the first place. So we have the movie. It conveys the stories in the book in a dark comedy manner and makes the financial jargons much simpler to understand, because well, you're not gonna bet on all your viewers being finance majors are you. It's a really good movie in all aspects, and I'm not saying that because it received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. But you do need to spend the time to watch the movie. And perhaps not everyone has the time to go watch a movie that is still somewhat heavy on concepts and jargons they're most likely not familiar with.

If you're a young adult like me, then chances are, your parents experienced the Great Recession for themselves. But they might not know exactly what the hell led to the recession. All they knew was that millions of people became unemployed, millions of people lost their homes, banks declared bankruptcy everywhere, so on and so forth. If your parents are in the US, then they might know a bit more details, but just a wee bit more. A couple of days ago, my mom and I were having a chat and we somehow got to the topic of the Great Recession. My mom only knew there was a recession at the time, and I decided to use what I've learned from *The Big Short* to explain to her everything in a simple way that she could understand. And just now I thought, "You know, I can write a blog about this". So that's why we have this blog post. Not to dig into the movie, but to explain the crisis itself. Though, if you do have time, I do really recommend watching the movie, either for further insights or just for the fun of it. It's a good movie in many aspects. You should also read the book if you know enough financial jargons.

Fair warning, this is a CS major with zero financial background trying to explain one of the biggest financial mess of all times. If you're gonna scrutinize this with your financial background, then fine, do what you want, but don't come asking me why it's not completely accurate. But if you're gonna share this post to your parents so that they have an idea of what the hell happened back then, then feel free to.

Anyways, let's get started.

#### 1. The initial brilliant idea

First, let's talk about mortgage. You wanna buy a house, but a house costs $500,000 and you basically do not have $500,000 at disposal. So, what do you do? You go to a bank and ask them nicely "Hey, can you guys lend me $500,000 to buy this house?". The bank then reviews every financial detail about you to determine if there's a good chance you'll be able to pay back the loan in full (low risk), or if there's a good chance you won't be able to (high risk). Regardless, you get the money, you buy the house, and you start making monthly payment to the bank, over the course of 30 - 40 years, until you pay up all the amount you borrowed, plus interest. Interest just means an additional amount to the amount you borrowed, and you have to pay this extra amount because the value of currency always changes and the bank needs something to cover their own ass, since they're already making a risky decision by giving you a huge amount of money. If you're low risk, you get lower interest rate. If you're high risk, you get higher interest rate, i.e. every month you pay more than the other guy with low risk. It makes sense, because the bank needs to cover their ass, and you have a bloody high chance of failing to pay them back.

And what happens if you fail to pay? Well, you lose the house, the bank now owns it and they sell it to someone else to get the money back. In finance, failing to pay is known as defaulting. So, if you fail to pay, you default. That's the jargon.

That, is the basics of mortgage.

Now, to quote Jared Vennett (played by Ryan Gosling) from the very opening of the movie. 

> "In the late 70s, banking wasn't a job you went in to make large sums of money. It was a fucking snooze."

It was a snooze because the monthly mortgage payment wasn't that grand or anything. The banks weren't losing money, but they weren't making much either. So, Lewis Ranieri came up with an idea to make it not a snooze.

Mortgage-backed securities, or MBS for short.

Wait, what the hell is MBS? Very simple. You take thousands of mortgages, you bundle them together like a cake, then you make slices out of the cake, and you sell those slices to investors. The mortgage payments go to the investors, and the banks receive commissions (fancy word for service fee) for selling those slices. In the lingo, that slice is called a bond. Or more specifically in this case, a mortgage bond. A bond is simply a contract between a bank and an investor. The bank says "I want to borrow your money to do my things" and the investor says "Sure, I'll give you my money, but you **must** pay me back in full, plus interest, on this specific date".

"Wait, isn't this the same as mortgage?"

Well, yes and no. The basic mechanism is indeed the same, but there are many nuances that differ mortgage and bond. For one, bond means a financial institution (i.e. bank) borrowing money from an investor, while mortgage means a normal person borrowing money from a financial institution. And then you have the differences in how the law works for each thing. Anyways, you get the idea.

The core idea about MBS was that the profit skyrocketed, but the risk was still low, because historically speaking, it was impossible for millions of people across the US to default, *at once*. So, even if some people defaulted at once, it would still barely do anything. And, and this is a big and. Even if someone couldn't afford to pay off their mortgage, they could always sell their house to someone else, since house prices had always gone up over the past 50 years or so. Keep these 2 assumptions in mind, because they were the 2 things every damn bank assumed at the time, and they were also the reasons why we had this crisis.

- Nationwide default is impossible.
- House prices always go up.

Anyways, with the birth of MBS, banks started making **large** sums of money thanks to the commissions from selling mortgage bonds. And as Jared Vennett hilariously narrated in the movie,

> "The money came raining down, and for the first time, the bankers went from the country club to the strip club."

#### 2. The first "brilliant" idea

However, there was a catch. 

Lewis' idea of MBS was solely concerned with low risk mortgages. That was why the MBS, when it first came out, received the AAA rating, the highest credit rating possible. However, there were only so many low risk mortgages. At some point, the banks ran out of low risk mortgages. And were they gonna stop this whole MBS thing? Of course not. So, what did they do? 

They took the high risk mortgages, bundled them together to keep making MBS, and they reasoned "well, given the 2 assumptions we said above, risky as these individual mortgages are, the MBS itself is still low risk". And to back these MBS up, the banks sliced these MBS into tranches (think of it as tiers), each with its own credit rating, from the highest AAA to the lowest B. If an investor purchased bonds from a AAA tranche, then they would be safe, but profit ain't much. If an investor purchase bonds from a BBB tranche, they would make more money due to the much higher mortgage interest rate, but the tranche was also riskier. An illusion created to make investors think they had a choice. And because of that, these MBS still received AAA rating. Very funny.

Additionally, to deal with the lack of good mortgages, the banks came up with a new product. Collateralized debt obligation, or CDO for short. This was where they took slices of different MBS that didn't sell, along with other kinds of debts that were not about mortgages, and bundled the whole thing into a MBS, only this time it's called a CDO because it's every debt instead of mortgage debt. And then they sold CDOs to investors, in tranches, just like MBS. And to quote Jared Vennett when he was explaining how dumb the entire system was to Mark Baum's team,

> ... and then the people at the rating agencies give it a 92, 93 percent AAA rating, no questions asked.

#### 3. The second "brilliant" idea

Eventually, the banks ran out of mortgages to even create MBS or CDO, let alone safe or risky. So, they came up with another "brilliant" idea. They got more and more lenient on mortgages. First, they gave mortgages to people with low credit scores. Then, they forgot that income verification was an actual thing. And finally, the worst of it all, they gave adjustable-rate mortgages. A normal mortgage has a fixed interest rate, you pay the samn amount every month. Adjustable-rate mortgage means you pay a small amount every month during the first 2 - 5 years, then you pay a much higher amount per month afterwards. And because of the 2 assumptions, this was still considered a good idea. And keep this in mind as well, we'll come back to it.

At this point, if you had a heart and it was still beating, you would almost certainly get an adjustable-rate mortgage. Just so they could have more mortgages to bundle into MBS/CDO. So, the individual mortgages got riskier and riskier, and the MBS and CDOs became more and more fragile. MBS got bad enough, and CDOs, which were filled mainly with MBS tranches that didn't sell because they were so crappy, went straight into the abyss. The AAA ratings were still there, and somehow investors still bought it.

At this point, like what Mark Baum said to Vinnie Daniel after his field investigation,

> Hey, there's a bubble.

#### 4. The third "brilliant" idea

Very unfortunately, that was still not the end of it. Because the banks got another "brilliant" idea. Synthetic CDOs. Any finanical product tends to have some kind of insurance for it, i.e. if you buy the insurance for product A and product A fails, then the insurance seller must pay you the full value of product A. But if it has yet to fail, you pay fees to maintain the insurance, also known as premiums. And there you have it, an insurance to bet against CDOs, also known as synthetic CDOs. The banks sold synthetic CDOs based on the same 2 assumptions, so they would only be making money from premiums and not lose anything. At this point, the banks were selling a gambling game to investors, and investors still bought the hell out of it for some reasons I could not comprehend.

As demonstrated in the movie, an initial mortgage bond of 50 million dollars could turn into 1 billion dollars through these layers of products. The market related to mortgage was 20 times bigger than the actual values of the mortgages. And to top it up, the movie narrated,

> If the mortgage bond was the match, and the CDOs was a kerosene-soaked rag, then the synthetic CDOS was the atomic bomb with a drunk president holding his finger over the button.

#### 5. The first domino fell

In 2007, the true interest rate of the adjustable-rate mortgages kicked in. And if you recall, at this point, almost every single mortgage is adjustable-rate. So, all of a sudden, people could not afford to pay their mortgage, **nationwide**. Across the entire US, people either lost their houses, or they sold their houses before the bank could claim them. Either way, suddenly the supply of houses skyrocketed, so the house prices plummeted. And when house prices plummeted, suddenly no one could sell their houses without incurring a massive loss, whether it was the ordinary people or the banks owning the houses they just claimed. Already, everyone had a massive loss that they could not do anything about it.

#### 6. More dominos fell

MBS were based on mortgages. CDOs were based on crappy MBS. Synthetic CDOs were based on CDOs. Now, once mortgages failed nationwide, every single one of these products collapsed entirely as well. Trillions of dollars vanished overnight, just like that.

The investors, who hoarded a ginormous amount of these products, went straight into the abyss. That included retirement savings, pension funds and several other essential funds. That much was rather straightforward.

The banks, however, did an even better job. They too hoarded those products, and there were also the synthetic CDOs they sold to investors. Hoarding those products meant they had a massive debt that they could not get rid of. Selling synthetic CDOs meant they had to bleed their own money to pay the insurance buyers. Loss of trust from everyone meant they could not borrow a single dime. Over the course of several months, the banks either declared bankruptcy, or was barely alive.

So, the banks collapsed nationwide. Which meant almost every single business had to halt, since there were no more money flow to fuel their operations. That is, if they haven't joined the investors in the abyss already. To sustain the business without the income flow, massive layoffs and hiring freeze were conducted everywhere. Millions of people became unemployed.

And that wasn't the worst of it. You really didn't think only US banks did this shit, did you? And just like that, the economy of the entire world collapsed. Hence we had the Great Recession.

#### 7. The lesson

The whole crisis came to be simply because banks and investors believed in mere assumptions without ever verifying it for themselves. It didn't matter how good the statistical models were, they were only as good as the people making them. And humans are inherently flawed.

I could go on and on about the 1000 different lessons to be learned from this one crisis. But Jared Vennett said it better.

"And they saw it by doing something the rest of the suckers never thought to do." <br>
"They looked."
