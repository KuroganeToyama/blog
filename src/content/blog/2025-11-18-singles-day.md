I shouldn't even have known that there's this thing in China called Singles' Day and it's celebrated on November 11. But I lived in Vietnam, so there's that.

Basically, it's a day where people celebrate the notion of being single. You know, not married, not in a relationship whatsoever, that kind of thing. Yet, despite the original intention, in the recent years, it has become more and more prevalent for young people in China to use this day to attend date parties to try and get their ass out of singlehood. Also, thanks to consumer culture, November 11 is more or less another Black Friday event in China. I think we have more or less the same thing going on in Vietnam.

From this point onwards, I'm just gonna be frank and rant.

Why the heck did we even bother to celebrate singlehood in the first place again? It's one thing if you're perfectly capable of living on your own without having to rely on a soulmate or whatever. That one, I'm perfectly fine with, and you're cool. But the thing is, more than likely, you're not fucking capable of doing that. You try to convince yourself that you can live a happy single life, but you really fucking cannot. You try to cope with your single life only to feel more pain whenever reminded of reality. So no, there isn't a fucking good reason to celebrate singlehood. Why the hell are you celebrating something that is hurting you?

I must say, social stigma is very real, even when I royally despise it. And apparently in China, it's very very bad if you stay single for the rest of your life. It's probably gonna take a couple more generations before this social stigma even begins to change. But yeah, it's sad that young people in China are finding partners because society forces them to do so, not because they want to. Marriage is never guarantee of happiness, but them boomers won't listen for whatever reasons. If anything, it hurts a whole hell lot more to be in a broken marriage than to be in singlehood. And like, if your marriage is only based on both of you trying to escape society judgement, then you have about 80% chance of divorcing within 2 years. And you only divorce because by that time you can no longer bear it. And none of you walks out of that in one piece. Plus, the world has become so fucked up that it's sincerely and royally hard to maintain a family in these days. So governments, please stop bitching about us young people choosing to stay single and not caring about the future. You didn't even give a shit about the future until the doom is impending, so don't fucking ask us to.

Yeah, I know that historically speaking, Vietnam had a lot of influence from China. But must we resume that same shit in these modern days? Because somehow we still are. I don't dislike the events, because I couldn't even care less about them. I dislike how we mindlessly copy stuff like it's the best fucking idea ever. It rarely is, okay? Perhaps you could try sitting down and think about what you're doing for a moment. Trust me, it helps.

Look, it's all about balance. Well, true balance is not real, as with perfection, but we can try to hit some level of balance. Most humans are social creatures, that much is out of the question. So unless you're outside of that most humans, you need a sense of belonging. However, rely on someone else too much and you cannot live a life at all, because they're not gonna stay with you for the rest of your fucking life. So, you need to be with someone to give yourself a sense of belonging, but you also need to be independent to live on your own. People like to talk about depending on someone and being independent like they're two completely opposite things. They're fucking not okay? They're both crucial aspects to your human being. You cannot live a good life without either.

Anyways, November 11 is not Singles' Day. It's Pocky Day. Go eat some Pocky.
