I had the idea of posting random stuff that I find interesting for quite some time.

I first tried with Twitter (I ain't gonna call that X). It worked fine, but then I figured it
wasn't the best way to recall my old tweets. So I ditched it. Now my Twitter is for collecting anime arts.

Then I contemplated Facebook. I realized I might post stuff that would beg questions from my social circle.
Not because the stuff is weird, it's just that I'm the most introverted person there is. People *will* ask me questions when they see me posting stuff. I really didn't want that. So I scrapped the idea.

And yeah, Instagram was definitely out of the question.

Then I tried out WordPress. It was working fine, but then I got absolutely fed up with the amount of tiny things I had to keep in mind. So WordPress became the bane of my existence.

Very quickly, Wix joined that club as well.

Then I tried building my blog from scratch. I went with Next.js cuz of React. If you're a frontend developer, you can see where this is going. It did not go well. Managing pages and styling was a royal pain. So while I got the blog to work, I just did not want to look at it again.

One day, I learned "goddamn, you can just write blogs with Markdown". And here we are, my blog built with Astro. So far, I'm enjoying this. The default template shipped by Astro is good enough for me. And I can use Markdown, a language I know very well.

So, what's the lesson?

Markdown is goated. Use Markdown.
